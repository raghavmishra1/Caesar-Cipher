Caesar Cipher Implementation in Python
This repository contains a simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher in Python. The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. It is one of the earliest and simplest forms of encryption techniques.

# Features
-->Encryption: Encrypts plaintext by shifting each letter by a specified number of positions.

-->Decryption: Decrypts ciphertext by reversing the shift applied during encryption
.
-->Case Preservation: Maintains the case (uppercase or lowercase) of the original text.

-->Non-Alphabetic Characters: Handles non-alphabetic characters by leaving them unchanged.

# How to Run
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/raghavmishra1/Implement-Caesar-Cipher
