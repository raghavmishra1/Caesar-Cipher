# 🛡️ Caesar Cipher Implementation in Python




A simple Caesar Cipher tool with encryption, decryption, and brute-force mode.

The Caesar Cipher is a classic encryption technique that shifts letters of the alphabet. This repo offers a beginner-friendly Python implementation with interactive CLI support.




## Features

🔐 Encrypt: Convert plaintext into ciphertext with a custom shift.

🔓 Decrypt: Revert the encrypted message using the original shift.

🧠 Brute-force Decrypt: Try all possible shifts to guess the original text.

🔤 Case Sensitive: Maintains uppercase/lowercase characters.

🔣 Handles Symbols: Leaves spaces, numbers, and special characters unchanged.
